## üì¶ Business Case: 
**Optimizing E-commerce Order Fulfillment: Analyzing Delivery Costs, Delays, and Performance Trends**

This project investigates the logistics efficiency of an e-commerce platform by analyzing real-world order, payment, and shipping data. It focuses on understanding delivery performance, shipping cost behavior, and product-level profitability to inform smarter supply chain and customer experience decisions.

Inspired by my professional experience as a **Logistics Analyst at Tesla** in the **Finished Vehicle Logistics** department, this project simulates a similar environment through the lens of last-mile delivery and fulfillment challenges in e-commerce.

1. **What is the average delivery time across regions, and which areas face the longest delays?**
2. **Which product categories contribute most to shipping costs?**
3. **How do different payment types relate to total order value or frequency?**
4. **What is the proportion of revenue spent on shipping, and how does it vary by product or customer location?**
5. **Which sellers or product categories deliver the highest profit margins after accounting for shipping costs?**
